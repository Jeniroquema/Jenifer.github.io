#### Why learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
Data science, a technical skill once not as known, now is used to shape many of the decisions that define everyday life. From the content we see online to the policies that affect education, healthcare, and housing, data-driven systems influence how resources are distributed and whose voices are amplified. Data is no longer just about numbers but rather it is about people, communities, and the structures that govern them.

Modeling social topics and people allows us to better understand patterns that are often invisible or overlooked at an individual level. Social data can reveal disparities, trends, and relationships that help explain why certain outcomes persist across time and place. However, people are not static variables. Social behavior is shaped by history, culture, and power, and these factors cannot always be captured in a dataset or in neatly organized excel sheets. When models fail to account for this complexity, they risk simplifying lived experiences or reinforcing existing inequalities.

Data about people carry real consequences, and handling it comes with serious responsibilities. One of the most important is protecting privacy and respecting consent, especially when individuals may not fully understand how their data is collected or used. There is also the responsibility to question bias. Data often reflects the systems that produced it, including structural inequities, and without critical evaluation, models can reproduce those same harms at scale. Ethical data science requires transparency, accountability, and an awareness of who benefits from data-driven decisions while also considering those who do not.

Through this course, I hope to better understand how data science can be practiced with intention and care. Beyond technical skills, I want to learn how to ask meaningful questions, interpret results thoughtfully, and consider the broader social impact of my work. Studying data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts emphasizes that innovation should not only be efficient or predictive, but also responsible, inclus
