### About Me
Hello! My name is Jenifer Roque-Martinez and I am a Data Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I enjoy programming, working with data, building projects, and learning how technology applies to the world around me.

In my free time I enjoy reading, playing video games, and baking!
